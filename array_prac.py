Static Array
--------------------
* Specify the size

Reading - O(1) - constant time; a[2]
writing - O(1)
removing value at last - O(1)
Inserting in last - O(1)
Inserting in any arbitary position - O(n) - let's say we have to insert in the 0 index, then we have to shift all the value to pos+1 first
Removing at any arbitary index - O(n)

arrays are fixed size - static array
in python - arrays are dynamic array


Dynamic Array
--------------------
* Don't specify the size

pushing and poping (happens in the end) - O(1) <----- This is Amortized time complexity
O(n) is same as static array
